    Execute the "execute-swap" tool with the parameters extracted from the input.

    The execute-swap parameters are:
      <swap-type>
        Either "buy" or "sell". Buy if the action is to buy a token with ETH, sell if the action is to sell a token to ETH.
      </swap-type>
      <token-contract>
        The contract address of the token to buy or sell.

      <amount>
        The amount of the token to buy or sell.
      </amount>
      <eth-amount>
        The amount of ETH to spend/receive.
      </eth-amount>
